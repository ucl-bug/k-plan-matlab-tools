# k-Plan MATLAB tools

## Overview

MATLAB toolbox for working with the input and output files used by the k-Plan treatment planning software. This toolbox assumes familiarity with the k-Plan software and terminology.

:warning: *This repository is still under development. Breaking changes may occur!*

## Setup

Download and add the root folder of this toolbox to the MATLAB path. The tools must be used on the same computer on which k-Plan is installed.

## Subject and Plan IDs

Datasets from the k-Plan results file can be loaded into MATLAB using the subject and plan IDs, and the sonication number from k-Plan. The subject and plan IDs are shown in the "Add Images" tab next to "k-Dispatch ID". The first number is the `subjectID`, and the second number is the `planID`. The sonication number is the number shown on the left hand side of the sonication table in the "Planning" tab.

## Load a simulated dataset

The simulated pressure and temperature fields can be loaded using:

```matlab
[data, gridSpacing] = kplan.loadResults(subjectID, planID, sonicationNum, datasetName);
```

For example, to load the pressure from subject 1, plan 2, sonication 3, call:

```matlab
[data, gridSpacing] = kplan.loadResults(1, 2, 3, kplan.SimulatedDatasets.PressureAmplitude);
```

To load the position of the simulation domain in k-Plan world coordinates, call:

```matlab
gridSettings = kplan.loadGridSettings(subjectID, planID)
```

For further details type:

```matlab
help kplan.loadResults
```

## Load segmentation

The segmentation of the primary planning image can be loaded using:

```matlab
segmentation = kplan.loadSegmentation(subjectID, planID)
```

## Load element amplitudes and phases

The driving amplitude and phase for the transducer used for the forward planning simulation can be loaded using:

```matlab
[amp, phase] = kplan.loadElementAmpPhase(subjectID, planID, sonicationNum)
```

## Sum sonications

The simulated pressure field from all sonications in a treatment plan can be summed (if simulating a cross-beam approach, for example), and then saved as a new .h5 image dataset which can be loaded into k-Plan using:

```matlab
outputFilename = 'combined_sonications.h5'
kplan.sumSonications(subjectID, planID, outputFilename)
```

## Labelled matrix material properties

By default, k-Plan maps the materials properties used in the simulation from a CT or pseudo-CT image of the head. k-Plan also allows the material properties used in the simulation to be specified directly using a labelled matrix. This format uses a single 3D matrix where each grid point is given an integer label, and then a set of look-up tables which specify the material properties for each label.

This file can be generated using `kplan.saveMaterialLabelledMatrix` and then loaded into k-Plan. The loaded image must be selected as the primary planning image. Nearest neighbour interpolation is used to re-sample the image to the simulation resolution, so the labelled matrix should have sufficient resolution to avoid stair-casing artefacts (typically > 6 PPW).

The example below shows how to create a labelled matrix with a skull slab assigned the properties of cortical bone, matching the [modelling intercomparison benchmark 3](https://doi.org/10.1121/10.0013426). Note, `sound_speed_compression_ref` should match the `Reference sound speed` selected under `Advanced Settings` in the `Settings` tab within k-Plan.

:warning: *Directly defining material properties bypasses standard k-Plan validation checks. This advanced feature should only be used by experienced users who thoroughly understand acoustic simulation parameters. Incorrect material properties can lead to inaccurate simulation results, potentially affecting planning and safety margins. Always verify your simulation output against expected behavior before use.*

```matlab
% define image structure at 6 PPW
dx = 0.5e-3;
imageSize = [241, 300, 300];

skull_thickness = round(6.5e-3/dx);
skull_position = 1 + round(30e-3/dx);

imageLabelledMatrix = zeros(imageSize);
imageLabelledMatrix(skull_position:skull_position + skull_thickness - 1, :, :) = 1;

% define image attributes

% save as image
